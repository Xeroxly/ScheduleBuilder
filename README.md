This project is written using Reactjs

It is a schedule page that can used to show the past and future schedule of a sports team.
For upcoming games it shows the date, time, and location (home or away) as well as the opponent, while leaving input boxes open for a score in the future.
For past games that have already finished it will show the opponent, location (home or away) as well as the score for the game.

To run this program enter 'npm start' in a linux terminal with npm installed and the web application will open on your default browser at localhost:3000

This project is also currently being hosted by Netlify at https://jovial-curran-eddc89.netlify.app/
